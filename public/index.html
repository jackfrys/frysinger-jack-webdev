            Hello! I am a third-year (almost fourth!!) undergraduate student at Northeastern University. I am majoring
            in Computer Science and am also working on minors in both Mathematics and Communication Studies. I have so
            far completed two co-ops, both working with Apple in Cupertino, California on the Siri team.
        </p>
        <p>
            This website is the home for my work in CS 4550 Web Development! I am was to web
            development in general, aside from some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, before beginning this
            course. I feel like it's a useful skill to have and I'm glad I put in the effort in this summer to learn
            someting new! The MEAN stack has really grown on me, and all the practice I've gotten has made it easier and
            more natural for me.
        </p>
        <p>I can't wait to create more in the future using my new skills!</p>
