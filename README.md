Hello! I am a third-year undergraduate student at Northeastern University. I am majoring in Computer Science and am also working on minors in both Mathematics and Communication Studies. I have so far completed two co-ops, both working with Apple in Cupertino, California on the Siri team.

This repository will include the source code for my work in CS 4550 Web Development. I am new to web development in general, aside from some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I feel like it's a useful skill to have and I'm looking forward to putting the effort in this summer to learn someting new!
